Ways you can Contribute to this project:

- [Lock Issues][issues] or help close them

- Help write Tests or improve Examples / Documentation
- Spread the word :heart:

## Issues

Found a bug, have some feedback or want some feature? Create an Issue. Here are some tips:

- Go through existing issues. Make sure that your issue doesn't exists (if it exists, you can :+1: it)
- If planning on helping close an issue, don't be shy. Ask questions and get more information before sending your PR.

- **Bugs**

  - Make sure it is really a bug. Read the docs first to be sure.
  - Provide as many details as you can about the bug. Steps to reproduce it?. What have you tried so far?

- **Features**

  - For feature requests, explain why is important and what improvements come from it.

## Pull Requests

Want to fix a bug, implement a feature or help with the tests / docs? Read this first:

- Make sure there's an open issue for what you're sending in your Pull Request. If not, [open it][issues].
- Send in your PRs agains the `dev` branch.
- Write unit tests / docs for any new feature you implement.
- Make sure your PRs pass all tests and CI.
- Be active in your relevant issue and PR threads.
- Make sure no one else is assigned or working on the issue. It's a good idea to leave a comment stating that you're going to implement it before sending in your PR. This way no two devs are working on the same thing.
